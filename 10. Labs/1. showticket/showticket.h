// A theatre sells seats for shows and needs a system to keep track of the seats they have sold tickets for. Define a class for a type called ShowTicket.
// The class should contain fields for the row, seat number, and whether the ticket has been sold or not. Define a constructor which accepts as arguments the row and seat number and sets the sold status to false in the constructor initialization section. Include the following member functions:
// A function to check if the ticket has been sold with this signature: bool is_sold();
// A function to update the ticket status to sold with this signature: void sell_seat();
// A function to print the row, seat number, and sold status delimited by a space with this signature: string print_ticket();
// An example use of your class can be found in showticket.cpp. The output from this sample would be:
// AA 101 sold
// AA 102 available

#include <string.h>                                 // required for strcpy() to work
using namespace std;
